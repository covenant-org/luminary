# NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Isaac

NVIDIA Isaac Sim is a high-fidelity robotics simulation application built on NVIDIA Omniverse. It is designed to help developers:

- Design, simulate, test, and train AI-based robots in photorealistic virtual environments
- Generate synthetic data for computer vision and sensor-based learning
- Integrate with ROS/ROS 2 and other robotics middleware for real-world deployment

Isaac Sim leverages NVIDIA RTX ray tracing, advanced GPU-accelerated PhysX-based physics, and Universal Scene Description (USD) to provide a scalable, modular simulation platform. Its companion tools (such as Isaac Lab) are used for robot learning and reinforcement learning (RL) experiments.

# HW Requirements 

- GPU: RTX 3060 ( will sufice)
- RAM: 32 GB ( may be need to upgrade )

# SF Requirements
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 - 24.04 (need to check dual boot options to maximamize local computational power usage)
- Docker ( maybe)
- VS Code
- GPU Drivers
- Isaac Sim (https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/4.5.0/installation/install_workstation.html)
