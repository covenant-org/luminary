**Mission 2: Find a person**  
In this mission, a textual description of a person will be provided to the team. This text will describe a
person who will be fully visible and located somewhere in the flight area. The description will include
the GPS position where the person is likely to be.  
The following are examples of textual descriptions:
- "Find the person with an orange jacket and a yellow construction helmet".
- "On the grass, there will be a person with red trousers, with glasses, and holding a suitcase".
- "There will be a person sitting on a bench holding an umbrella with a computer next to her".  
 
Points will be given if:
- The MAV arrives at the GPS target location autonomously.
- The MAV finds the person described in the textual description. As evidence of this, the
drone has to land autonomously near the person within a radius of 2 m.
