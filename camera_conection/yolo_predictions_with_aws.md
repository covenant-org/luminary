- Options to make inferences of extracted frames located in the s3 bucket: 
- 1. Lambda functions
  2. Sagemaker
 
- Lambda function seems to have a simpler and more cost effective implementation
- Implemented base code for the Lambda function

## Todo
- Make function access frames in s3 bucket
- Put configuration of own s3 bucket
- Schedule to run every time a new frame is detected in s3 bucket
- Test
